DSTools
=======

DSTools is a project to make analysis on various popular data science tools 
and libraries. The analysis will be focusing on topics as below:

* What capability does the tool or library have?
* What scenario does the tool or library apply?
* Github insights of the tool or library.
* Popularity or trend of the tool or library.
* Important things around the tool or library.

Data science tool and library goes to five main categories below:

* Data Analytics
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* NLP
