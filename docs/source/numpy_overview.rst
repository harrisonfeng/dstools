Technical Details
-----------------

*NumPy* is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. 
It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, 
various derived objects (such as masked arrays and record arrays), and 
an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including 
mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, 
discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical 
operations, random number generation and much more.

Applications
------------

*NumPy* is used in virtually every large company in tech and finance 
and at every major university. It has been used at the NBA; at Apple 
which ships *NumPy* as part of OSX, at Microsoft in Microsoft Azure 
Machine Learning Studio, and at Intel in the Intel Distribution for 
Python.
