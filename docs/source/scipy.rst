SciPy
=====

The SciPy library is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack. 
It provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as 
routines for numerical integration and optimization.


History
-------

In the 1990s, Python was extended to include an array type for numerical 
computing called Numeric (This package was eventually replaced by Travis 
Oliphant who wrote NumPy in 2006 as a blending of Numeric and Numarray 
which had been started in 2001). As of 2000, there was a growing number 
of extension modules and increasing interest in creating a complete 
environment for scientific and technical computing. In 2001, Travis Oliphant, 
Eric Jones, and Pearu Peterson merged code they had written and called the 
resulting package SciPy. The newly created package provided a standard collection 
of common numerical operations on top of the Numeric array data structure. Shortly 
thereafter, Fernando PÃ©rez released IPython, an enhanced interactive shell widely 
used in the technical computing community, and John Hunter released the first version 
of Matplotlib, the 2D plotting library for technical computing. Since then the SciPy 
environment has continued to grow with more packages and tools for technical computing.
