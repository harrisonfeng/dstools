Pandas is a data wrangling platform for Python widely adopted in the 
scientific computing community. pandas provides easy-to-use data 
ingestion, transformation, and export functions. Pandas project is `NumFOCUS`_ 
sponsored project since 2015.

Technical details
-----------------

Pandas is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data 
structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Pandasâ€™ 
data analysis and modeling features enable users to carry out their entire data 
analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain-specific 
language like R. The library is highly optimized for performance, with critical 
code paths written in `Cython`_ or C.

Applications
------------
As a foundational data wrangling tool, Pandas is used in virtually every large 
company in tech and finance and at every major university.

Features
--------

* DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
* Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different file formats.
* Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
* Reshaping and pivoting of data sets.
* Label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets.
* Data structure column insertion and deletion.
* Group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.
* Data set merging and joining.
* Hierarchical axis indexing to work with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure.
* Time series-functionality: Date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging.
* Provides data filtration.
