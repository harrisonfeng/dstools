*NumPy* is a universal data structure that fundamentally enables data analysis 
in numerical computing by permitting the exchange of data between algorithms. 
It is a foundational project for the Python scientific computing stack and 
contains among other things:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object.
* sophisticated(broadcasting) functions.
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.
* useful linear algerbra, Forier transform, and random number capabilities.

Besides its obvious scientific uses, *NumPy* can also be used as an efficient 
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be 
defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide 
variety of databases.

*NumPy* is a `NumFOCUS`_ sponsored project since 2015.
